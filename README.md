🌦️📱 "Weather App" - A Technical Triumph and a Step Forward in My Internship Journey! ☀️❄️

Hello! 📱🌈 Today, I'm excited to introduce you to "Weather App" a pivotal project in my internship journey that combines technical prowess and innovation. Here's a peek into the fascinating tech behind it:

🌐 **Retrofit Mastery**: As part of my internship, I've harnessed the power of Retrofit to connect effortlessly to a REST web service, fetching real-time weather data based on city names with precision and speed.

🌆 **Dynamic Backgrounds**: "Weather" is not just about data; it's about creating immersive experiences. The app dynamically transforms its background with four enchanting animations - Sun, Rain, Cloud, and Snow - reflecting the current weather conditions.☀️🌦️☁️❄️

🌞 **Animated Weather**: It goes a step further by animating the content with four dynamic wallpapers - Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, and Snowy - that align with the weather at hand, enhancing the user experience.

📊 **Data-Driven Design**: In this internship task, I've crafted a user-centric UI that beautifully presents a wealth of weather insights, including Temperature, Wind, Humidity, Condition, Sunrise, Sunset, and Sea Level. It's all about making data come alive.

☔ **Internship Journey**: "Weather" represents a significant milestone in my internship journey, where I've put my skills to the test, learned new techniques, and contributed to creating an innovative app.🌦️🌨️ 

Must use your own API key from openweathermap.
MainActivity -> fetchWeatherData() ->  val yourApiKey = "your openweathermap api key" // change this variable to your unique API Key
